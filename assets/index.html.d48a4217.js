The figure below shows an example.</p><div align="center"><img src="'+h+'" width="50%" height="50%"></div><ol><li>The subject and object entities involved in a relation may appear in different sentences, e.g., the relation between <strong>Baltimore</strong> and <strong>U.S.</strong>, as well as <strong>Eldersburg</strong> and <strong>U.S</strong>.</li><li>The same entity may be mentioned multiple times in different sentences.</li><li>The identification of many relations requires techniques of logical reasoning, e.g., <strong>Eldersburg</strong> belongs to <strong>U.S.</strong> because <strong>Eldersburg</strong> is located in <strong>Maryland</strong>, and <strong>Maryland</strong> belongs to <strong>U.S.</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="our-proposed-model-gain" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#our-proposed-model-gain" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Our proposed Model: GAIN</h2><p>To tackle the challenges, we propose <strong>G</strong>raph <strong>A</strong>ggregation-and-<strong>I</strong>nference <strong>N</strong>etwork (<strong>GAIN</strong>). GAIN consists of double graph, i.e., mention-level graph and entity-level graph. Our intuitions are that: 1) Mention-level graph can model the interactions among mentions across sentences, so that global context can be better captured. 2) Entity-level graph can conduct logical reasoning for certain entity pairs over entities.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="image3"></p><p>Our model contains the following four modules.</p><p><strong>Encoding module</strong>. Tokens of the document is represented as the concatenation of word embedding, entity type embedding, and entity id embedding. Then they are fed into the encoder (e.g., LSTM or BERT) to obtain the contextualized representation.</p><p><strong>Mention-level Graph Aggregation Module</strong>. To model the document-level information and interactions among mentions, a heterogeneous mention-level graph is constructed followed by graph convolution network. The graph has two kinds of nodes: 1) <em>Mention node</em>, which refers to one specific entity mention in the document; 2) <em>Document node</em>, which aims to model the overall document information and serves as a pivot for interactions among different mentions. Three types of edges are leveraged to connect these nodes:</p><ul><li><p><em>Intra-Entity Edge</em>: Mentions referring to the same entity are fully connected with intra-entity edges. In this way, the interaction among different mentions of the same entity could be modeled.</p></li><li><p><em>Inter-Entity Edge</em>: Two mentions of different entities are connected with an inter-entity edge if they co-occur in a single sentence. In this way, interactions among entities could be modeled by co-occurrences of their mentions.</p></li><li><p><em>Document Edge</em>: All mentions are connected to the document node with the document edge. With such connections, the document node can attend to all the mentions and enable interactions between document and mentions. Besides, the distance between two mention nodes is at most two with the document node as a pivot. Therefore long-distance dependency can be better modeled.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Entity-level Graph Inference Module</strong>. To explicitly capture the logic reasoning chain of entity pairs over all the entities, we constuct an entity-level graph by merging mention nodes referring to the same entity in the mention-level graph into an entity node. Concretely, to model the logical chain between a certain entity pair, we find out all the two-hop paths between them, in which a path is represented as the concatenation of both forward and backward edges. Then we levelrage attention mechanism to aggregate multiple paths into a reasoning-aware path representation.</p><p><strong>Classification Module</strong>. Since a pair of entities may contain multiple relations, we formulate the task as a multi-label classification. Concretely, we first concatenate the entity, document, and path representations. Then we feed it into a MLP and use sigmoid function to predict the score for all possible relations.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="image4"></p><h2 id="experiments" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#experiments" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Experiments</h2><h3 id="dataset" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#dataset" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Dataset</h3><p>We evaluate our model on DocRED (Yao et al., 2019), a large-scale human-annotated dataset for document-level RE constructed from Wikipedia and Wikidata.

In this paper, we introduce Graph Aggregationand-Inference Network (GAIN) to better cope with document-level relation extraction, which features double graphs in different granularity. GAIN utilizes a heterogeneous Mention-level Graph to model the interaction among different mentions across the document and capture document-aware features. It also uses an Entity-level Graph with a proposed path reasoning mechanism to infer relations more explicitly. Experimental results on the large-scale human annotated dataset, DocRED, show GAIN outperforms previous methods, especially in inter-sentence and inferential relations scenarios. The ablation study also confirms the effectiveness of different modules in our model.</p><h2 id="reference" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reference" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reference</h2><ul><li>Shuang Zeng, Runxin Xu, Baobao Chang, Lei Li.
