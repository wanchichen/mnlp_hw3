Assuming that we are translating English (EN) into Chinese (CN), our translation goal is TM<sub>EN-CN</sub>. BT considers another TM<sub>CN-EN</sub> that translates Chinese sentences back to English. With the back-translated English sentences, BT treats the additional EN-CH sentences to further train TM<sub>EN-CN</sub>. By alternative training TM<sub>EN-CN</sub> and TM<sub>CN-EN</sub>, we can improve TM<sub>EN-CN</sub> by pseudo-parallel pairs. Although BT increases translation performance, both TM<sub>EN-CN</sub> and TM<sub>CN-EN</sub> are updated independently, which limits the effectiveness of using non-parallel sentences.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rpj2IFj.png" width="30%"><h2 id="mgnmt" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mgnmt" aria-hidden="true">#</a> MGNMT</h2><h3 id="overview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Overview</h3><p>MGNMT is a unified NMT framework that considers both source-target and target-source translation models (TM) with their respective language models (LM). Both TM and LM share the semantic space, making it more efficient when learning from the non-parallel corpus. In addition, LM can further improve the text quality during the decoding step of TM. Inspired by generative NMT (GNMT), MGNMT introduces a latent semantic variable z and adopts symmetry of mirror-image properties to decompose the conditional joint probability p(x, y | z):</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zXfL7CY.png" width="60%"><ul><li>(x, y): source-target language pair;</li><li>\u0398: trainable model parameters for TM and LM;</li><li>D_xy: parallel source-target corpus;</li><li>D_x and D_y: non-parallel monolingual corpus.</li></ul><h3 id="parallel-training" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parallel-training" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Parallel Training</h3><p>Given a parallel corpus (x, y), MGNMT adopts stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) to obtain an approximate maximum likelihood estimate of log p(x, y):</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RvtbmWh.png" width="60%"><p>and the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) can be derived as:</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kH82Wt1.png" width="60%"><p>Through reparameterization, we can jointly train the entire MGNMT via gradient-based optimizations for parallel-corpus training.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XzRf5Uz.png" width="30%"><h3 id="non-parallel-training" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#non-parallel-training" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Non-parallel Training</h3><p>To utilize non-parallel corpus, MGNMT designs an interactive training method by back translation (BT).

However, such simple interpolation (LM-FUSION) over NMT and external LM only brings out mild effects.
