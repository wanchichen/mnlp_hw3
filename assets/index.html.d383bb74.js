Such issues hinder applying BERT sentence embeddings directly to many real-world scenarios where collecting labeled data is highlycosting or even intractable.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="image2"></p><h2 id="major-questions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#major-questions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Major Questions</h2><p>In this paper, we aim to answer two major questions:</p><ul><li><p>(1) why do the BERT-induced sentence embeddings perform poorly to retrieve semantically similar sentences? Do they carry too little semantic information, or just because the semantic meanings in these embeddings are not exploited properly?</p></li><li><p>(2) If the BERT embeddings capture enough semantic information that is hard to be directly utilized, how can we make it easier without external supervision?</p></li></ul><h2 id="our-findings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#our-findings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Our Findings</h2><p>We argue that the semantic information in the BERT embeddings is not fully exploited. We first reveal the theoretical connection between the masked language model pre-training objective and the semantic similarity task theoretically, and then analyze the BERT sentence embeddings empirically. We find that BERT always induces a non-smooth anisotropic semantic space of sentences, which harms its performance of semantic similarity.</p><h3 id="the-anisotropic-embedding-space-of-bert" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-anisotropic-embedding-space-of-bert" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Anisotropic Embedding Space of BERT</h3><p>Gao et al. (2019) and Wang et al. (2020) have pointed out that, for language modeling, the maximum likelihood training with Equation 1 usually produces an anisotropic word embedding space. \u201CAnisotropic\u201D means word embeddings occupy a narrow cone in the vector space. This phenomenon is also observed in the pretrained Transformers like BERT, GPT-2, etc (Ethayarajh, 2019).</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="image3"></p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Tips</p><p>The BERT word embedding space.

(2019), anisotropy is highly relevant to the imbalance of word frequency. We observe that high-frequency words are all close to the origin, while low-frequency words are far away from the origin.</p><p>This phenomenon can be explained through the softmax formulation of (masked) language models. Note that there is a word-frequency term in the decomposition of the dot product between context and word embeddings. Nevertheless, the PMI term is still highly associated with semantic similarity.</p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="'+m+'" width="400"><img src="'+g+'" width="400"></div><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">Remark</p><p>We expect the embedding induced similarity to be consistent to semantic similarity.

By fitting a mapping to an isotropic distribution, the singular spectrum of the embedding space can be flattened. In this way, the word frequency-related singular directions, which are the dominating ones, can be suppressed.</li><li>Second, the probabilistic density of Gaussian is well defined over the entire real space. This means there are no \u201Chole\u201D areas, which are poorly defined in terms of probability. The helpfulness of Gaussian prior for mitigating the \u201Chole\u201D problem has been widely observed in existing literature of deep latent variable models (e.g., variational auto-encoders).</li></ul><p><img src="'+b+'" alt="image8"></p><h2 id="experiments" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#experiments" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Experiments</h2><p>Experimental results show that our proposed BERT-flow method obtains significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art sentence embeddings on a variety of semantic textual similarity tasks.</p><h3 id="results-w-o-nli-supervision" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#results-w-o-nli-supervision" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Results w/o NLI Supervision</h3><p>We perform extensive experiments on 7 standard semantic textual similarity benchmarks without using any downstream supervision.
